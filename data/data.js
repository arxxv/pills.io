If anyone is thinking they will want to have children in the future I do no recommend this birth control as it really messed my hormones up.”",

About three months ago the side effects started up again and have become worse. For preventing a pregnancy, they work well but for mood swings and cramps it’s actually making them worse for me.”",

I was super happy in the beginning because my migraines stopped completely, but with the time the other side effects became worse and worse: my breasts are extremely swollen and painful, my husband cannot hug me, it really hurts, terrible cramps, spotting for 15 days non stop and mood swings. I had to stop unfortunately. I'm not sure if Cerazette could be better, but looks like is about the same.”",

I had a regular period every month once my body adapted to the new hormone changes. When I turned 26 I had to switch to my own insurance and Gianvi was no longer free on my new plan, so I switched to Junel Fe for all of 2020 - biggest mistake of my life. My periods were irregular / I would go months without even getting one, my mood swings were horrible, and my skin started to break out on my back and my face. Last month I went back on my insurance to see how much Gianvi would be because I couldn't be on Junel Fe anymore, and Gianvi was free again! So I immediately switched back and my skin is already starting to improve. Gianvi is one of three qualified combination pills for acne purposes, so I highly recommend this if you are having acne problems.”",
